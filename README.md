# React TODO App

## Overview

This is a simple TODO app built using React. The app provides basic functionalities such as adding todos, clearing completed todos, and keeping track of the remaining todos. The todo list is also stored in local storage for persistence.

## Functionalities

### 1. Add Todo

Users can add new todos by entering the todo text in the input field and clicking a button to add it to the list.

### 2. Clear Todo

Users can clear completed todos, removing them from the list.

### 3. See Remaining Todos

The app displays the number of remaining todos to complete, providing a quick overview of the tasks that still need attention.

### 4. Store Todos in Local Storage

The todo list is stored in the browser's local storage. This allows users to revisit the app and see their todos even after refreshing the page or reopening the browser.

The app consists of the following components:

- `App`: The main component that renders the entire application.
- `TodoList`: Component for displaying the list of todos.
- `Todo`: Component representing an individual todo item.
